# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal repository named `cursor-background-agent` that currently contains:
- A simple bash script example (`hello_world.sh`) that prints "Hello World!" in Chinese and English
- Basic README.md with just the repository name

## Project Structure

The repository is extremely minimal with only two files:
- `README.md` - Contains only the project name
- `hello_world.sh` - A simple shell script demonstration

## Development Commands

Since this is a basic shell script repository with no build system or dependencies:

### Running the script
```bash
chmod +x hello_world.sh
./hello_world.sh
```

### Making the script executable (if needed)
```bash
chmod +x hello_world.sh
```

## Architecture Notes

This appears to be a starter/example repository or placeholder project. There are no:
- Package managers (no package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Build systems or configuration files
- Test frameworks
- Linting or formatting tools
- CI/CD configurations

The repository is ready for development of a background agent project but currently only contains a basic shell script example.
